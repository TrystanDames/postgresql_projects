COnnecion vs transaction:
Connection:

can be either sending or receiving data related to one query at a time.

Transaction:

> all querys run in a transaction.
> linear and synchronous.
> Also runs one query at a time.

Locking in PostgreSQL:

> Table-level locking(limited acces to tables)
> Row-level locking(limited acces to individual rows)
> Advisory locking (just suggestions, doesnt actually limit)

Table-level:

Table require while working on a table.
there are diffrent types:

Current lock mode
Requested lock mode
etc.

Try not to do manual locking.
